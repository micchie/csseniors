This script shows the author's papers published in the venues listed in
[CSRankings](http://csrankings.org), counting only those which have been
published since their first first-author paper in those venues.
The rational of such a list is that the first authorship indicates the work
driven (including *built*) by their own, which proves the experience to establish some seniority.
Since such a paper can be published later than others simply because of rejections,
this script also considers those papers published in the previous calendar year.
